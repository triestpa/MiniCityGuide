"Boston","United States","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/USA_Old_State_House_1_MA.jpg/450px-USA_Old_State_House_1_MA.jpg","Walk the Freedom Trail the first time you visit Boston, and you'll quickly get a sense of this coastal city's revolutionary spirit and history. But make sure you also explore some of Boston's fine museums (try the Gardner, featuring art masterpieces displayed in their collector's mansion) and old neighborhoods (like the North End, Boston's Little Italy). You can't claim to have experienced real Boston culture, though, unless you've watched a Red Sox baseball game from the bleachers."
"New York City","United States","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/NYC_wideangle_south_from_Top_of_the_Rock.jpg/800px-NYC_wideangle_south_from_Top_of_the_Rock.jpg","Conquering New York in one visit is impossible. Instead, hit the must-sees – the Empire State Building, the Statue of Liberty, Central Park, the Metropolitan Museum of Art – and then explore off the beaten path with visits to The Cloisters or one of the city’s libraries. Indulge in the bohemian shops of the West Village or the fine dining of the Upper West Side. The bustling marketplace inside of Grand Central Station gives you a literal taste of the best the city has to offer."
"San Francisco","United States","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/2010_Golden_Gate_Bridge.jpg/800px-2010_Golden_Gate_Bridge.jpg","Every neighborhood in San Francisco has its own personality, from the hippie chic of the Upper Haight to the hipster grit of the Mission. The Marina district boasts trendy bistros and postcard-perfect views of the Golden Gate Bridge, while Noe Valley offers quaint and quiet boutiques. Wave hello to the sea lions at Pier 39, and sample local cheese and charcuterie at the Ferry Building. Sit in on a yoga session in Dolores Park or marvel at the Dutch Windmill across from Ocean Beach."
"Tokyo","Japan","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Tokyo_odaiba.jpg/800px-Tokyo_odaiba.jpg","Tradition collides with pop culture in Tokyo, where you can reverently wander ancient temples before rocking out at a karaoke bar. Wake up before the sun to catch the lively fish auction at the Tsukiji Market, then refresh with a walk beneath the cherry blossom trees that line the Sumida River. Spend some time in the beautiful East Gardens of the Imperial Palace, then brush up on your Japanese history at the Edo-Tokyo Museum. Don’t forget to eat as much sushi, udon noodles, and wagashi (Japanese sweets) as your belly can handle."
"Beijing","China","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/BeijingTiananmenSquare.jpg","Welcome to a capital city whose story goes back at least 3000 years. In Beijing, you'll find a wealth of history, both ancient (the Hall of Preserving Harmony, Summer Palace, Forbidden City) and more recent (Chairman Mao Memorial Hall, Tiananmen Square). For the best market experience, choose the Dirt Market over the touristy Silk Market. A visit to the Great Wall, the longest manmade structure in the world, is absolutely essential."
"Istanbul","Turkey","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Mosques_in_Istanbul_at_dusk.jpg/450px-Mosques_in_Istanbul_at_dusk.jpg","The mosques, bazaars, and Turkish baths of Istanbul could keep you happily occupied for your entire trip: an eyeful of breathtaking architecture here, a good-natured haggle over a carpet there. Kick your trip off at the awe-inspiring Sultan Ahmet Camii (Blue Mosque), which is visible from many points of the city. Stroll the Galata Bridge and stop by the Miniaturk Park to see its tiny artifacts. The Grand Bazaar has thousands of shops to browse, while the Egyptian Bazaar is a fragrant trove of spices and fruits."
"Rome","Italy","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Roma_dall%27aereo.JPG/800px-Roma_dall%27aereo.JPG","Rome wasn't built in a day--and you'll need much more than a day to take in this timeless city. The city is a real-life collage of piazzas, open-air markets, and astonishing historic sites. Toss a coin into the Trevi Fountain, contemplate the Colosseum and the Pantheon, and sample a perfect espresso or gelato before spending an afternoon shopping at the Campo de’Fiori or Via Veneto. Enjoy some of the most memorable meals of your life here, too, from fresh pasta to succulent fried artichokes or a tender oxtail stew."
"London","United Kingdom","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Palace_of_Westminster%2C_London_-_Feb_2007.jpg/800px-Palace_of_Westminster%2C_London_-_Feb_2007.jpg","The crown jewels, Buckingham Palace, Camden Market…in London, history collides with art, fashion, food, and good British ale. A perfect day is different for everyone: culture aficionados shouldn't miss the Tate Modern and the Royal Opera House. If you love fashion, Oxford Street has shopping galore. For foodies, cream tea at Harrod’s or crispy fish from a proper chippy offers classic London flavor. Music and book buffs will love seeing Abbey Road and the Sherlock Holmes Museum (at 221B Baker Street, of course)."
"Prague","Czech Republic","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Prague_Castle_from_Vltava_bank.jpg/800px-Prague_Castle_from_Vltava_bank.jpg","The bohemian allure and fairytale features of Prague make it a perfect destination for beach-weary vacationers who want to immerse themselves in culture. You could devote an entire day to exploring Prazsky hrad (Prague Castle), then refueling over a hearty dinner at a classic Czech tavern. Spend some time wandering the Old Town Square before heading over to gape at The Old Town Hall and Astronomical Clock. Prague’s best bars are found in cellars, where historic pubs set the scene for a night of traditional tippling."
"Marrakech","Morocco","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Museum_of_Marrakech.JPG/800px-Museum_of_Marrakech.JPG","The “Red City” of Marrakesh is a magical place, brimming with markets, gardens, palaces, and mosques. Exploring the intimate courtyards and snaking alleyways of the historic Medina can easily eat up a day. Find inner peace at the serene Jardin Majorelle or take in the beauty of one of the city’s historic mosques (taking note that, unless you are Muslim, you are not allowed to enter)."
"Paris","France","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Arc_Triomphe.jpg/553px-Arc_Triomphe.jpg","Lingering over pain au chocolat in a sidewalk café, relaxing after a day of strolling along the Seine and marveling at icons like the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe… the perfect Paris experience combines leisure and liveliness with enough time to savor both an exquisite meal and exhibits at the Louvre. Awaken your spirit at Notre Dame, bargain hunt at the Marché aux Puces de Montreuil or for goodies at the Marché Biologique Raspail, then cap it all off with a risqué show at the Moulin Rouge."
"Hanoi","Vietnam","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Sunrise_Hanoi_np.jpg/800px-Sunrise_Hanoi_np.jpg","The charming Vietnamese capital has aged well, preserving the Old Quarter, monuments and colonial architecture, while making room for modern developments alongside. Hanoi may have shrugged off several former names, including Thang Long, or ""ascending dragon,"" but it hasn't forgotten its past, as sites such as Ho Chi Minh's Mausoleum and Hoa Lo Prison attest. Lakes, parks, shady boulevards and more than 600 temples and pagodas add to the appeal of this city, which is easily explored by taxi."
"Siem Reap","Cambodia","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Siem_Reap_Pubstreet.jpg/800px-Siem_Reap_Pubstreet.jpg","When the morning light washes over the overgrown temples and ruins of Angkor Wat, a simple Siem Reap sunrise becomes a profound event. The ancient structures are contained within one of the largest religious complexes in the world. The complex and the 12th century Angkor Thom royal city are considered the main reasons to visit Siem Reap. Get a lesson in national history at the Cambodian Cultural Village, and a lesson in bargaining at the Angkor Night Market, a bonanza of shopping stalls, food vendors, and bars."
"Berlin","Germany","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Brandenburger_Tor_abends.jpg/800px-Brandenburger_Tor_abends.jpg","Berlin is an edgy city, from its fashion to its architecture to its charged political history. The Berlin Wall is a sobering reminder of the hyper-charged postwar atmosphere, and yet the graffiti art that now covers its remnants has become symbolic of social progress. Check out the Weltzeituhr (world time) Clock, topped by a model of the solar system, then turn back time by dining at the historic Zur Letzten Instanz, a 16th century restaurant that was frequented by Napoleon and Beethoven."
